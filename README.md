## Stakeholders

Kuan Wei, a 22-year-old frequent (4-6 times every year) traveler who relies on existing traveling apps and websites to plan his trip with his girlfriend, found it very frustrating to find realistic reviews and avoid misleading information when building the plan. He desires relaxed planning experiences with efficient budget management. True, updated, and quick information about costs and the level of relaxation of attractions is just what he needs. Kuan feels that sharing personal preferences with an AI app is acceptable. Our mobile app, which is designed to include real-time updates on flights, weather, and local events, budget tracking and cost optimization calculator, and cross-referencing hot online travel posts with real reviews will enhance his trip planning experience in the way he wants.
